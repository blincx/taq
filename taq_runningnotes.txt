taq notes:

need algorithm get_next_move to check not only
for open "dangerous spaces"
but if the space in between two "dangerous spaces" is
occupied, then not to choose that space

in other words.

user clicks 2
and already owns 8
we would need to check if 5 was empty before
returning 5


You_win()
just make the wincom flash between blank and O or X
Time.Millisecond.sleep or whatever
